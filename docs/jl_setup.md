# JL Setup

## Basic Configuration

Once you've got JL installed and connected to AnkiConnect, you'll need to configure it for the Lapis note type. Open the Preferences menu and click on the `Anki` tab. Choose your deck from the `Deck` dropdown, and then select Lapis as the `Note Type`.

Set up your fields according to the following table:

## AJT Configuration

To set up the Sentence Furigana, please see [AJT Japanese Setup](anki_setup.md).

## Limitations

JL does not have support for exporting multiple dictionary definitions, so the Glossary field is not supported with JL.
